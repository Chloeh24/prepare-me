## Week 1 Design Week

### Introduction

Thanks for helping us today. My name is [NAME], Iâ€™m a developer. 

Today we are testing a mock-up of an app that allows people to create their own picture stories. Please bear in mind we are testing the prototype not you and we value critical feedback as much as positive. 

Please also think out loud and ask questions as you go, we won't be able to answer most of your questions but it is very helpful to us to hear them.

Hello, sorry to butt in. Not sure if you saw this but I wrote out the available routes for the dentist template. Maybe it will help

**Dentist journey -** Select template, go to next page, delete that page, add a page, choose the template with one picture, add a picture from photos (can toggle to google search and go back), go to next page and start over (there is no print or save page yet)

### Kick off questions

May I ask you a few initial questions about yourself?

What is your occupation?

What is the main browser you use?

google chrome

How much do you use your phone vs a laptop when on the
internet?

if i am creating resourcec, like picture stories its pc but she uses phone mostly. 

### Whilst using the app

Task 1: Could you create a picture story using a blank template?

Task 2: Can you create a set of PECS cards from a blank template?

Task 3: Can you find the page to print, download and start over?

### Further Questions

How was your overall experience moving around the app?

Now you have an idea what the web app is doing, what else would you like it to do?

Anything else you feel we should know?

## Things we need to fix:

- she can't go back to the home menu. she thinks it is easier to have access to landing page anytime.  jumping back will be easier.
- i don't like to crop it and prefer to have the picuture.
- she prefers to separate google photos and MY PHOTOS. she could not distinguish if it was her photos she was gonna see or something else. she would like to access gallery photos from her device.
- she said I was gonna lose what i have done. i want to go back without losing the work i have done. this was after seeing the do you want to quit message and she got worried that she could not go back without losing stuff. i want to be able to move freely and maybe tweak something but not delete what i already have done.
- I can add another page. add page is not clear because she thought it was the whole template that she was choosing and she thought she was returned back instead of realising that she was adding a new page.

### Things that we expected and we were right:

- the add page is epxected to add her own page on to it.
- she expects download to downoad the story on the phone.
- she expects that back button to go back.
- when I click page template I expect that same layout would open. when you give me 4 options i want to see them according to the layout.
- it is easy to use once it's clear where I am getting the pictures from. if I selected the other picture I would be able to use them for the specs.

## notes and comments:

you might want more specific pictures and text and she recommends us to have more guided user journey.

people stare a lot when you carry big things. and she would prefer if the user can download them. she thinks that phones are great. 

if i am clicking on phone this is gonna save to my phone but to be able to have that information on the work device. can i access my work on pc. just saving something on the pc that would be fantastic. to have a sharing link or something. is cross-platform access possible? 

I need to access on something else or let others to finish my work or other way around. 

google pictures - I wanted pecs for days and I was getting all the days together and I could not crop it properly. she wants to optimise the time and workflow when making pecs.

images are a very crucial part of the app. things and the flow seemed quite easy but blockers were could not click the layout and could not select images I wanted.

she would love to have speach recognition as an additional functionality. 

she really want people to access across the deviceses. 

i have to do to many steps to make my layout presentable.

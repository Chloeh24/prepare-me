## Week 1 Design Week

### Introduction

Thanks for helping us today. My name is [NAME], Iâ€™m a developer. 

Today we are testing a mock-up of an app that allows people to create their own picture stories. Please bear in mind we are testing the prototype not you and we value critical feedback as much as positive. 

Please also think out loud and ask questions as you go, we won't be able to answer most of your questions but it is very helpful to us to hear them.

### Kick off questions

#### May I ask you a few initial questions about yourself?

Aine, pronounced Awnia.

What is your occupation?

Stay at home mum, was a drama teacher. Trained in industrial design.

#### What is the main browser you use?

Google chrome

#### How much do you use your phone vs a laptop when on the
internet?

Almost exclusively use phone, only uses PC when they really have to. Has an android tablet but uses phone way more.

### Whilst using the app

#### Task 1: Could you create a picture story using the dentist template?

- Can you change the picture on the template?

Found page okay. Asked to change image, clicked on image, Asked to go to next page, found next page, could delete, could add a page, went home - not fazed by lose all work 

- Can you delete the second page?
- Can you add a new page?
- Can you add a picture?

#### Task 2: Can you create a set of PECS cards from a blank template?

Found template okay

Asked to add picture, clicked on plus, clicked on plus agin

Search on google, oh that's handy

Likes that cropping is included "I would really want to crop and sometimes flip things"

Square is standard for PECS, number might be variable.

User would add page to add more than 12

Save button expectation: not usre if save function within the app or save as PDF. Would expect "download to save, probably and image to the phone".

#### Task 3: Can you find the page to print, download and start over?

Top right template looks best for A4

Wondered if selecting a page template would give same template for every page.

User could edit image as expected

User asked to make font bigger.

Font size control too small

User would try and highlight all text and look for options

User would try and unpich to zoom text in on phone

Pleasantly surprised to see templates are 'per page'

### Further Questions

#### How was your overall experience moving around the app?

#### Now you have an idea what the web app is doing, what else would you like it to do?

It's simplistic (good I think!). If somebody not au fait then explanatory text or page about PECS & Social Stories would be handy.

Templates: Not clear images were replaceable. But picture examples were valuable.

Landing page: Didn't understand destination was print at first

Would like a view mode (without edit & controls) for kids use.

Would use as it is, even the barebones version we have now.

Prints via computer, saves stuff from phone to google drive to print, would love to print from phone if poss, not usre how though.

#### Anything else you feel we should know?

Link to [prepareme.ie](http://prepareme.ie) website

Would like option to print as booklet! Would layout 2 pages

Print draft version would be welcome options

Speech bubble would be nice. Icons.

Bold would be helpful.

Customising text: Would like to personalise you dentist story / enter childs name up front.

Priority for ready mades: School template and Social distancing.

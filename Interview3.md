### Introduction

Thanks for helping us today. My name is [NAME], Iâ€™m a developer. 

Today we are testing a mock-up of an app that allows people to create their own picture stories.

lease bear in mind we are testing the prototype not you and we value critical feedback as much as positive. 

Please also think out loud and ask questions as you go, we won't be able to answer most of your questions but it is very helpful to us to hear them.

Make sure to explain that it is a wire-frame!!!!  

### Kick off questions

#### May I ask you a few initial questions about yourself?
#### What is your occupation?
#### What is the main browser you use?
#### How much do you use your phone vs a laptop when on the internet?

When you want to make picture stories, what device would you normally use?

### Whilst using the app

**Dentist journey -** Select dentist template, go to next page, delete that page, add a page, choose the template with one picture, add a picture from photos, go to next page and start over (there is no print or save page yet)

#### Task 1: Could you create a picture story using a blank template?

#### Task 2: Can you create a set of PECS cards from a blank/given template and print it/download it?

#### Task 3: Can you find the page to save, share or print your story?

#### Task 1: Could you create a picture story using a blank template?

#### Task 2: Can you create a set of PECS cards from a blank template?

#### Task 3: Can you find the page to print, download and start over?

### Further Questions

#### How was your overall experience moving around the app?
#### Now you have an idea what the web app is doing, what else would you like it to do?
#### Anything else you feel we should know?

image search options? cropping

I am social career worker. I use PC for work and tablet or phone. At work i use laptop and microsoft office to make picture stories. we take pictures from perosons device or sometimes internet. 

she is trying to make the text bigger.

she was trying to right click and remove it. 

the picture url part is not clear and maybe we should provide more info or what we are looking for.

instead of copy and paste i would prefer to ....

URL link is not clear at all. we should make it clearer what we need in there.

she prefers to save it on the server but pdf is good option as well.

it was fine,it was more or less what i expected, maybe copy and paste is hard for the suers. Maybe it would be easier to get pictures from the device, but i was not sure how to put picture url in there.

it was simple and user friendly we should make clearer how to add pictures. We have to make it obvious. 

the app is clear to use on the phone or the app.

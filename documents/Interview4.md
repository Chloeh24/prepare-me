## Week 2 Build- Thursday 11am

Name: Laura

### Kick off questions

#### May I ask you a few initial questions about yourself?

#### What is your occupation?

- Manager, Social worker

#### What is the main browser you use?

- Google

#### How much do you use your phone vs a laptop when on the internet?

- Phone or Ipad

#### When you want to make picture stories, what device would you normally use?

- Picture that have been gathered themselves, or google search, then just play around it
- phone or ipad ideally, on the go

### Whilst using the app

Visit the address: [https://prepare-me.netlify.app/](https://prepare-me.netlify.app/)

#### What are your initial thoughts?

- different colour then before

School journey - Create a picture story about your child's first day at a new school. Edit the text and change the pictures to fit. When you are done, download the story.

- clicked picture story, then story template
- surprised that it was already done
- didn't know straight away that you could customise
- asked "how can i change that"
- did realise that clicking on the image and text can be edited,
- had a bit of tech difficulties, a very long time to load upload image ... very long
- cloudinary widget comes up when unresponsive
- had a bit of tech difficulties, took a while for the text to respond
- **would have thought that you would have another option in the nav bar like add a picture**
- would expect to be taken somewhere where you can add image or goggle search
- would expect recently use or frequently used bank of images to have quick access
- understood drop and drop straight away

### Current experience making stories

absolute nightmare to make your template,

have to make your own template, put in text box yourself, add images yourself, google search image elsewhere, add them, then layout will miss up, trying to find the images you want, especially with pecs,

try to crop, won't let you

just trying to find the actual images you need

to long, can do a quick spontaneous one on the go

### Things that would be nice

Liked the difference choices of template, text box and layout

Need to be able to add page in between pages

Access photos that you already know is useful

flip images

print, read mode

save onto the app,

### Top Navigation Bar

- home understood
- add page understood
- page layout page liked, very helpful
- add a schedule page template, board maker meeting agenda
- would like for schedule page to be at the end of the templates
- more freedom with being able to add text box and images on the page
- would go to the end if you wanted to /download/print was first response
- noticed after the vertical bar 2 secs later
- would expect to download to download whole story, with format same format then on prepare me builder

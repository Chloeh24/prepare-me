### Introduction

Thanks for helping us today. My name is [NAME], Iâ€™m a developer. 

Today we are testing a mock-up of an app that allows people to create their own picture stories.

Please bear in mind we are testing the prototype not you and we value critical feedback as much as positive. 

Please also think out loud and ask questions as you go, we won't be able to answer most of your questions but it is very helpful to us to hear them.

Make sure to explain that it is a wire-frame!!!!  

### Kick off questions

May I ask you a few initial questions about yourself?
What is your occupation?
What is the main browser you use?
How much do you use your phone vs a laptop when on the internet?

When you want to make picture stories, what device would you normally use?

### Whilst using the app

**Dentist journey -** Select dentist template, go to next page, delete that page, add a page, choose the template with one picture, add a picture from photos, go to next page and start over (there is no print or save page yet)

Task 1: Could you create a picture story using a blank template?

Task 2: Can you create a set of PECS cards from a blank/given template and print it/download it?

Task 3: Can you find the page to save, share or print your story?

### Further Questions

How was your overall experience moving around the app?
Now you have an idea what the web app is doing, what else would you like it to do?
Anything else you feel we should know?
